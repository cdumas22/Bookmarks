To accomplish this set us a scheduled task in windows to run the Bookmarks.ps1 script.\r\n\r\nYou can find the app by going to the URL: http://localhost:3001\r\n\r\nIf you are using chrome you can install the chrome bookmarklet plugin. To do this open the folder with the project and go to Views/Chrome_Plugin/ and drag the file Bookmarks.safariextension.crx onto an open window in chrome. Chrome will ask you if you want to install the plugin. Click yes. Now you can use the bookmarklet to create bookmarks for whichever page you are currently viewing.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
